Background:
In recent months, I've grown fond of the Readiness Score feature in the Oura Ring, an aspect the Apple Health App doesn't offer. 
Seeking to replace the Oura Ring with a device that is not as bulky, I explored other Apps and ways to incorporate this feature. 
Unfortunately, none solved my need.

After trying to create a Shortcut to replicate this functionality, I encountered limitations and inaccuracies in the results. 
The lack of a suitable alternative in existing apps led me to develop my own solution.

Implementation:

HealthGPT is the result â€“ a user-friendly app that comprehensively tracks key health metrics. It includes:

Total Sleep: Monitoring the full duration of sleep.
Deep Sleep: Measuring the deep, restorative phases.
REM Sleep: Tracking the vital Rapid Eye Movement phase.
Core Sleep: Assessing the core sleeping period.
Time in Bed: Logging the total time spent in bed.
Average Heart Rate: Calculating the daily average.
Resting Heart Rate: Monitoring during periods of rest.
Blood Oxygen: Measuring oxygen saturation levels.
Respiratory Rate: Tracking breathing rate.
Body Temperature Baseline: Observing regular body temperature.
Stress Level: Derived from Heart Rate Variability Baseline.
Readiness Score: An innovative feature inspired by Oura, assessing daily readiness based on various health metrics.


Installation:
To use HealthGPT, clone the repository and add a Config.plist file with the name APIKey including your API Key. 
Access to GPT-4 is a prerequisite. 
The app is compatible with Apple Watches capable of blood oxygen measurement and requires iOS 17.1 or later.

HealthGPT is offered under the MIT License, promoting open and adaptable use and distribution.
